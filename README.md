# 👋 Hi, I'm Leonardo Rojo  
### Structural Engineer · Software Architect · Creator of Intelligent Engineering Systems  
**Founder of Rufus Engineering**

I build high-performance engineering software used in real infrastructure and building projects.  
My work combines structural engineering rigor, computational geometry, BIM interoperability and AI-driven automation.

## 🔍 Technical Focus  
- Computational modeling & data structures  
- Geometry pipelines & custom 3D visualization  
- Analytical ↔ physical model consistency  
- BIM interoperability (SAF/JSAF, Tekla, Robot)  
- AI-assisted workflows & multi-agent automation  
- Modern .NET/WPF architectures (MVVM, DDD)

---

## 🧱 Domain Expertise  
15+ years in structural engineering (bridges, viaducts, deep foundations, RC & steel)  
10+ years building engineering applications:

- Analytical models  
- Soil/stratigraphy modeling  
- Reinforcement & design workflows  
- Model versioning & geometry audits  
- Robot, Tekla, and SAF/JSAF integrations  
- Applied AI for structural model evolution
