# 👋 Hi, I'm Leonardo Rojo

**Structural Engineer · Software Architect · BIM & AI Solutions Developer**

I create high-performance engineering software used in real infrastructure and building projects.  
My work integrates **structural engineering expertise**, **advanced .NET development**, and **AI-driven workflows** to deliver reliable, scalable tools for design and analysis.

---

## 🌐 Professional Focus

I specialize in designing systems that bring together:

- **Civil & Structural Engineering Logic**  
- **Computational Geometry & 3D Visualization**  
- **BIM Interoperability & Data Modeling**  
- **Machine Learning & AI-assisted design**  
- **Modern .NET/WPF application architecture**

My background includes more than 15 years in infrastructure and building structures (bridges, viaducts, deep foundations, RC and steel systems), combined with 10 years building engineering applications.

## 🧱 Key Projects

### **CivilPlan**
Enterprise-grade platform for structural and geotechnical design in infrastructure projects.  
Includes analytical models, 3D visualization, soil layers, load management, reinforcement design, and workflow automation.

### **IngeniumApp / WISE**
A modular environment for building analysis models, designed for multi-user collaboration and alignment with BIM workflows.

### **StructML / MeshMaster**
Framework for versioning, analyzing, and comparing structural models and triangulated meshes.  
Provides ML-ready data, semantic/episodic memory, and multi-level diffs.

### **Viewer3D.Core**
High-performance 3D engine for engineering visualization (meshes, solids, heatmaps, bar diagrams, sections).

### **ProjectMemory**
AI-supported memory architecture for large codebases:  
structured logs, semantic summaries, context persistence, and GitHub Actions automation.

### **RobotStructuralConnect**
Interop toolkit for Autodesk Robot Structural Analysis (RobotOM API), modernized for .NET 8.

## 🧩 A Bit More About Me

I’ve always been a builder—first with physical objects, later with software.  
Today I apply that same creative mindset to engineering technology:  
systems that are reliable, elegant, and conceptually solid.
